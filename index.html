            <h2>Press Kit</h2>
            <p><strong>Development Story:</strong> "The Shadow That Follows" began as a skeleton project when we first started. We used basic tile assets, then built the foundation of a haunting mental facility. From there, we carefully added sprites, breathing life into the dark and twisted hallways.</p>
            <p>As the core mechanics took shape, we implemented the entity that follows players, then fine-tuned its behavior to ensure it evokes a genuine sense of fear using sound assests. We turned to polishing the atmospheric lighting, sound effects, and unsettling environmental details to create an eerie experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Trailer Creation:</strong> Making the trailer was a long process, and to capture key moments of tension and dread, using cinematic camera angles and sound design to reflect the essence of the game. The goal was to give players a taste of the fear and challenge that "The Shadow That Follows" promises, before they actually play the game.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Horror?</strong> We wanted to create a game that resonates deeply with players, immersing them in an atmosphere where every choice feels critical. Horror is the perfect genre to evoke raw emotions and we really enjoyed the creative process of going for a horror approach.</p>
