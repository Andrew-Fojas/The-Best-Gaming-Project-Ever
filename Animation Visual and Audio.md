Game Feel:
- The assets that were chosen, such as the reaper sprite, spike traps, and blood effects, contribute to the horror atmosphere of the game, emphasizing on an eerie and unsettling environment. Vibrant-colored hazards such as spikes and reaper provide instant feedback to players about danger, creating a sense of urgency and reinforcing the horror atmosphere. Other vibrant objects such as the torch, indicate saftey and comfortability to the player, affirming that they are headed in the right direction. Additionally, the smooth animations of traps and the reaperâ€™s movement contribute to the gameplay's fluidity and immersiveness.

Graphic Design:
- The use of monotone colors for the overall map creates a sense of unease and unfamiliarity, while the choice of vibrant assets symbolizes danger. Levels progress in difficulty, with level one's exit being a room away and having level three's exit be completely across the map. The design of the levels are to support the narrative. Level one's layout is similar to a family home while the layout for level three be more maze-like and difficult to navigate with dead-ends, traps and empty rooms. 

World-Building:
- Along with the use of a montone color pallate for the tilemap, the levels and decoration contribute to the narrative. The first two levels contain much more decoration and furniture fit for a home, such as bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, etc. However, as we reach the third level, the overall layout becomes more dull and lifeless. This shift reflects the player's descent into psychological warfare, transitioning from a place of comfort and familiarity to an unsettling, unknown environment.

- The audio system was designed to immerse players into an unsettling atmosphere and enhance the emotional tone of the game. The main menu music includes tones of somber and mystery, to slowly ease the player into our horror atmosphere.

- There are pecific in-game events  that trigger sound effects:
    - Example: When the Reaper attacks, the Sword Swing Attack sound effect plays, synced to the animation.
    - Example: Reaper creepily laughs randomly through the game and levels.

-  For enhanced realism, I added sound effects like footsteps, and other members of the group added sound effects to our in-game objects such as the torch, spikes and typing.
