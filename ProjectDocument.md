# The Shadow That Follows #

## Summary ##

**The Shadow That Follows is a 2-D horror game that has players navigate through a dark, trap-filled maze while avoiding a deadly monster. Prepare yourself for a suspenseful, immersive experience where players feel the tension of survival as they search for the maze’s exit.

## Gameplay Explanation ##

**2-D Horror game where your goal is to escape the mental facility. The exit at every level is covered in blood for easier recognition of the escape. You must avoid the deadly spikes, the shadow grim reaper, and escape the level in time or you die. The game always restarts at level 1, so make sure to memorize the escapes of previous levels to help alleviate the anger that is going through levels again.**

*Control Scheme:*

**WASD or Arrows Keys: Up, Down, Left Right**

**Spacebar: Dash Movement**

# External Code, Ideas, and Structure #

If your project contains code that: 1) your team did not write, and 2) does not fit cleanly into a role, please document it in this section. Please include the author of the code, where to find the code, and note which scripts, folders, or other files that comprise the external contribution. Additionally, include the license for the external code that permits you to use it. You do not need to include the license for code provided by the instruction team.

If you used tutorials or other intellectual guidance to create aspects of your project, include reference to that information as well.

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer - Andrew Fojas

**Describe the steps you took in your role as producer. Typical items include group scheduling mechanisms, links to meeting notes, descriptions of team logistics problems with their resolution, project organization tools (e.g., timelines, dependency/task tracking, Gantt charts, etc.), and repository management methodology.**

*Main Platform Creation* - I created a discord server to serve as our main communication platform. I set up important channels such as role-related channels, meeting details, documents/assets, and announcements. (Everyone was notified beforehand that class faculty may join to see this server as documentation) [Discord Server Invite](https://discord.gg/v8PDcrHbmF)
